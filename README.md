## Install

### Deno 🦕

In Deno you can either import code inside a file directly or go through an
import map.

- Using imports (import map)

Add it to your imports:

```sh
deno add @edouardmisset/utils
```

Then import it in you files:

```typescript
// The entire lib
import * as mod from '@edouardmisset/utils'

// Only selected function
import { capitalize } from '@edouardmisset/utils'
```

- Directly in file

Import it in your file:

```typescript
// The entire lib
import * as mod from 'jsr:@edouardmisset/utils'

// Or fix a specific version
import * as mod from 'jsr:@edouardmisset/utils@1.0.0'

// Only selected function
import { capitalize } from 'jsr:@edouardmisset/utils@1.0.0'
```

### npm / yarn / pnpm / bun

```sh
# npm
npx jsr add @edouardmisset/utils

# yarn (version 3+ includes dlx subcommand)
yarn dlx jsr add @edouardmisset/utils

# pnpm
pnpm dlx jsr add @edouardmisset/utils

# bun
bunx jsr add @edouardmisset/utils
